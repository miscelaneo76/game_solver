Thank you for using our Chrome Extension ("Extension"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes what information is collected and how it is used when you use our Extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

When you use the Extension, it may automatically collect and process data from specific HTTP requests made by your browser. This includes:

- **Local data** saved on your device for functionality purposes. This data is not transmitted to our servers.
- **Response bodies** of certain web requests (e.g., API responses or page content).

This data is used **locally** within your browser and is **not sent to any external servers** or stored beyond what is necessary for immediate functionality.

We do **not** collect or store:

- Personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email, passwords, or IP address.
- Full browsing history.
- Any information unrelated to the specific requests the extension is designed to handle.

---

## 2. How We Use the Data

The collected response data is used **exclusively to provide functionality within the browser window**, such as displaying relevant information based on the request contents, local data or window content.

We do **not**:

- Send the data to external servers.
- Use it for analytics, advertising, or profiling.
- Share it with third parties.

All processing is done **locally** within your browser session.

---

## 3. Permissions

The Extension may request permissions such as:

- `webRequest` or `webRequestBlocking` – to intercept HTTP requests and responses.
- Access to specific websites or domains – to interact with relevant content.

These permissions are used **only** for the core functionality of the Extension and not for any form of data collection beyond what is described here.

---

## 4. Data Retention

No data is stored or retained by the Extension beyond the current browsing session. Once a session ends, all processed data is discarded.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

This Extension does **not** integrate with any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

---

## 6. User Consent

By installing and using the Extension, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy.
